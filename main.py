# Change get_current_watchlist to return []. This simulates a user with an empty watchlist.

#  First: Hide the <h2>My Watchlist</h2> and it's unordered list.
#  Second: Hide the crossoff form, since there are no movies to cross off. 
# Then you can change get_current_watchlist back to the list of hard-coded movies.
